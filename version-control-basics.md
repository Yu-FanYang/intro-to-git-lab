# Definition of version control:
Version control for Git is a way to track changes to files over time. It is useful in software development especially work in groups that each member work on the same codebase. It allows the members to track revision history and rollback capabilities. Developers can also create braches to work on the projects and then merge the code into main code.


# Key Features of Git
- Distributed Architecture: Each user has a full copy of the repository, allowing offline work and eliminating single points of failure.
- Branching & Merging: Enables developers to work independently on different features and merge changes seamlessly.
- Data integrity: Uses cryptographic hashing to protect data from corruption.
- High Performance: Optimized for speed and efficiency, even with large repositories.

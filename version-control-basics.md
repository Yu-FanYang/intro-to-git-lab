Definition of version control:
Version control for Git is a way to track changes to files over time. It is useful in software development especially work in groups that each member work on the same codebase. It allows the members to track revision history and rollback capabilities. Developers can also create braches to work on the projects and then merge the code into main code.

Key features of Git:
Git is widely used for developers for managing source code. The key features includes the following:
1.Distributed System: Each member can work on their own repository for independent work.
2.Branching and Merging: Each member can create branches to work on the features on their own and merge the changes into the main source code.
3.History and Tracking: Git maintains a record of every change that allow to rollback to previous versions when needed.
4.Collaboration: Multiple members can work on the same project.
5.Security: Git uses cryptographic hashing to ensure security and authenticity of files.

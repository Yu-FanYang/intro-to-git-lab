# intro-to-git-lab
This repository is for the version control lab assignment

## Name: Yu-Fan Yang

## Favorite programming language: My favorite programming language is Python. It allows both interactive mode and script mode that are useful for beginners and professionals.

# Project Overview
The purpose of CheckPoint 1 is to introduce students to version control, Git fundamentals, and GitHub for collaboration and project managment.
Key Learning Outcomes:
- Understand the concept and purpose of version control.
- Learn basic Git commands.
- Create and manage GitHub repository.
- Write a well-structured README file using Markdown.
- Collaborate using GitHub features like pull requests and issue tracking.

# Key Concepts:
## Importance of Version Control
- Track Changes: Maintains a history of edits, additions, and deletions for easy reference.
- Facilitates Collaboration: Enables multiple developers to work on a project without conflicts.
- Ensures Backup & Recovery: Provides a safety net to revert to previous versions if needed.
- Resolves Conflicts: Helps manage simultaneous changes by different contributors.
- Supports Auditing & Accountability: Keeps a record of who made changes and when.

## Key Features of Git
- Distributed Architecture: Each user has a full copy of the repository, allowing offline work and eliminating single points of failure.
- Branching & Merging: Enables developers to work independently on different features and merge changes seamlessly.
- Data integrity: Uses cryptographic hashing to protect data from corruption.
- High Performance: Optimized for speed and efficiency, even with large repositories.

# How to Run This Project:

# Definition of version control:
Version control for Git is a way to track changes to files over time. It is useful in software development especially work in groups that each member work on the same codebase. It allows the members to track revision history and rollback capabilities. Developers can also create braches to work on the projects and then merge the code into main code.

Key features of Git: Git is widely used for developers for managing source code. The key features includes the following: 1.Distributed System: Each member can work on their own repository for independent work. 2.Branching and Merging: Each member can create branches to work on the features on their own and merge the changes into the main source code. 3.History and Tracking: Git maintains a record of every change that allow to rollback to previous versions when needed. 4.Collaboration: Multiple members can work on the same project. 5.Security: Git uses cryptographic hashing to ensure security and authenticity of files.
